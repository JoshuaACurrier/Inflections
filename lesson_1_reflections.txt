This is a simple text document to get me used to using a text editor.
I am using VIM since I am most familiar with this work.

How did viewing FC between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It is nice that the program highlights the exact differences between the original code and the second one. 
This helps with error checking after commiting a large amount of changes. Although I find that an IDE
would catch simple spelling errors.
